          The very first thing we need to do is to tell the HTML document that
          we have some CSS rules we want it to use. There are three different
          ways to apply CSS to an HTML document that you'll commonly come
          across, however, for now, we will look at the most usual and useful
          way of doing so — linking CSS from the head of your document.
        </p>
        <p>
          Create a file in the same folder as your HTML document and save it as
          <code>styles.css</code>. The <code>.css</code> extension shows that
          this is a CSS file.
        </p>
        <li>
          To link <code>styles.css</code> to <code>index.html</code> add the
          following line somewhere inside the <code>< head ></code> of the HTML
          document:
        </li>
        <code>
          <p>< link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css" ></p>
        </code>
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <li>
          This link element tells the browser that we have a stylesheet, using
          the <code>rel</code> attribute, and the location of that stylesheet as
          the value of the <code>href</code> attribute. You can test that the
          CSS works by adding a rule to <code>styles.css</code>. Using your code
          editor add the following to your CSS file:
        </li>
        <code>
          <p>
            h1 { <br />
            color: red; <br />
            }
          </p>
        </code>
        <p>
          Save your HTML and CSS files and reload the page in a web browser. The
          level one heading at the top of the document should now be red. If
          that happens, congratulations — you have successfully applied some CSS
          to an HTML document. If that doesn't happen, carefully check that
          you've typed everything correctly.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can continue to work in <code>styles.css</code> locally, or you
          can use our interactive editor below to continue with this tutorial.
          The interactive editor acts as if the CSS in the first panel is linked
          to the HTML document, just as we have with our document above.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Styling-section">
        <header>
          <a id="Styling-title"></a>
          <h2>Styling HTML elements</h2>
        </header>
        <p>
          By making our heading red we have already demonstrated that we can
          target and style an HTML element. We do this by targeting an
          <em>element selector</em> — this is a selector that directly matches
          an HTML element name.
          <li>
            To target all paragraphs in the document you would use the selector
            p. To turn all paragraphs green you would use:
          </li>
        </p>
        <code>
          <p>
            p { <br />
            color: green; <br />
            }
          </p>
        </code>
        <p>
          Try this out in the interactive editor below (edit the code boxes), or
          in your local CSS document.
        </p>
        <img src="Screenshot (16).png" alt="" />
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Changing-default-section">
        <header>
          <a id="Changing default elements"></a>
          <h2>Changing default elements</h2>
        </header>
        <p>
          When we look at a well-marked up HTML document, even something as
          simple as our example, we can see how the browser is making the HTML
          readable by adding some default styling. Headings are large and bold
          and our list has bullets. This happens because browsers have internal
          stylesheets containing default styles, which they apply to all pages
          by default; without them all of the text would run together in a clump
          and we would have to style everything from scratch. All modern
          browsers display HTML content by default in pretty much the same way.
        </p>
        <br />
        <li>
          However, you will often want something other than the choice the
          browser has made. This can be done by choosing the HTML element that
          you want to change, and using a CSS rule to change the way it looks. A
          good example is our, an unordered list. It has list bullets, and if I
          decide I don't want those bullets I can remove them like so:
        </li>
        <code>
          <p>
            li { <br />
            list-style-type: none; <br />
            }
          </p>
        </code>
        <li>Try adding this to your CSS now.</li>
        <br />
        <p>
          The <code>list-style-type</code> property is a good property to look
          at on MDN to see which values are supported. Take a look at the page
          for list-style-type and you will find an interactive example at the
          top of the page to try some different values in, then all allowable
          values are detailed further down the page.
        </p>
        <p>
          Looking at that page you will discover that in addition to removing
          the list bullets you can change them — try changing them to square
          bullets by using a value of square.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section">
        <header>
          <a id="Adding-a-class"></a>
          <h2>Adding a class</h2>
        </header>
        <p>
          So far we have styled elements based on their HTML element names. This
          works as long as you want all of the elements of that type in your
          document to look the same. Most of the time that isn't the case and so
          you will need to find a way to select a subset of the elements without
          changing the others. The most common way to do this is to add a class
          to your HTML element and target that class.
        </p>
        <li>
          In your HTML document, add a class attribute to the second list item.
          Your list will now look like this:
        </li>
        <code>
          <p>
            < ul > <br />
            < li >Item one< /li > <br />
            < li class="special">Item two< /li > <br />
            < li >Item < em >three< /em >< /li > <br />
            < /ul >
          </p>
        </code>
        <li>
          In your CSS you can target the class of special by creating a selector
          that starts with a full stop character. Add the following to your CSS
          file:
        </li>
        <code>
          <p>
            .special { <br />
            color: orange; <br />
            font-weight: bold; <br />
            }
          </p>
        </code>
        <li>Save and refresh to see what the result is.</li>
        <p>You can apply the class of <code>special</code>to any element on your page that you want to have the same look as this list item. For example, you might want the </code>< span ></code> in the paragraph to also be orange and bold. Try adding a <code>class</code> of <code>special</code> to it, then reload your page and see what happens.</p>
        <li>Sometimes you will see rules with a selector that lists the HTML element selector along with the class:</li>
        <code>
          <p>li.special { <br>
            color: orange; <br>
            font-weight: bold; <br>
          }</p>
        </code>
        <li>This syntax means "target any li element that has a class of special". If you were to do this then you would no longer be able to apply the class to a <code>< span ></code> or another element by adding the class to it; you would have to add that element to the list of selectors:</li>
        <code>
          <p>
            li.special, <br>
            span.special { <br>
              color: orange; <br>
              font-weight: bold; <br>
            }
          </p>
        </code>
        <p>As you can imagine, some classes might be applied to many elements and you don't want to have to keep editing your CSS every time something new needs to take on that style. Therefore it is sometimes best to bypass the element and refer to the class, unless you know that you want to create some special rules for one element alone, and perhaps want to make sure they are not applied to other things.</p>

        <header id="Styling-things-based-on-state">
          <a id="Styling-things-based-on-state"></a>
          <h2>Styling things based on state</h2></header>
          <p>The final type of styling we shall take a look at in this tutorial is the ability to style things based on their state. A straightforward example of this is when styling links. When we style a link we need to target the < a > (anchor) element. This has different states depending on whether it is unvisited, visited, being hovered over, focused via the keyboard, or in the process of being clicked (activated). You can use CSS to target these different states — the CSS below styles unvisited links pink and visited links green.</p>
            <code>
              <p>
                a:link { <br>
                  color: pink; <br>
                } <br>
                <br>
                a:visited { <br>
                  color: green; <br>
                }
              </p>
            </code>
            <li>You can change the way the link looks when the user hovers over it, for example by removing the underline, which is achieved by the next rule:</li>
            <code>
              <p>a:hover { <br>
                text-decoration: none; <br>
              }</p>
            </code>
            <p>
            In the live example below, you can play with different values for the various states of a link. I have added the rules above to it, and now realize that the pink color is quite light and hard to read — why not change that to a better color? Can you make the links bold?
          </p>
            <img class="Styling-things-based-on-state" src="./Screenshot (18).png" alt="">
            <p>We have removed the underline on our link on hover. You could remove the underline from all states of a link. It is worth remembering however that in a real site, you want to ensure that visitors know that a link is a link. Leaving the underline in place can be an important clue for people to realize that some text inside a paragraph can be clicked on — this is the behavior they are used to. As with everything in CSS, there is the potential to make the document less accessible with your changes — we will aim to highlight potential pitfalls in appropriate places.</p>
